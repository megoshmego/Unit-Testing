In this transcript, the narrator discusses writing tests using the Jasmine testing framework. Here are the important terms and ideas mentioned:

1. Jasmine: Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework for JavaScript. It provides a syntax for writing tests and assertions.

2. Test file: A separate file where test code is written. It typically has a ".test" extension and contains Jasmine test code.

3. Spec: In Jasmine, a spec represents a group of related tests. It is created using the `it` function, which takes a string description and a callback function containing the actual test logic.

4. Expectation: In Jasmine, expectations are assertions used to define the expected outcome of a test. They are written using the `expect` function, followed by a matcher function to compare the actual and expected values.

5. Matcher: Matchers in Jasmine are functions that compare actual and expected values to determine if a test passes or fails. Examples include `toEqual`, `toBeGreaterThan`, `toBeFalsy`, and `toBeBetween`.

6. Test coverage: The degree to which the code is exercised by tests. It is important to ensure that tests cover different scenarios, including edge cases and typical use cases.

Here's a code snippet demonstrating the concepts discussed in the transcript:

```javascript
// taxes.js (code being tested)
function calculateTaxes(income) {
  if (income > 30000) {
    return income * 0.25;
  } else {
    return income * 0.15;
  }
}

// taxes.test.js (test file)
describe("Tax calculations", () => {
  it("should calculate the high tax bracket", () => {
    expect(calculateTaxes(50000)).toEqual(12500);
    expect(calculateTaxes(100000)).toEqual(25000);
  });

  it("should calculate the low tax bracket", () => {
    expect(calculateTaxes(10000)).toEqual(1500);
    expect(calculateTaxes(1000)).toEqual(150);
    expect(calculateTaxes(0)).toEqual(0);
  });
});
```

In this example, we have a `calculateTaxes` function in `taxes.js`, and we write tests for it in `taxes.test.js` using Jasmine. The tests cover both the high and low tax brackets and check if the calculated taxes match the expected values.

Note: The code snippet is a simplified example. In a real application, you would typically have more complex tests and assertions to cover various scenarios and edge cases.
