Term: `describe`
Definition: The `describe` function in Jasmine is used to group related tests (specs) together. It takes a string description and a callback function that contains the actual tests.

Term: Spec grouping
Definition: Spec grouping refers to organizing tests into logical groups based on functions, modules, or other relevant criteria. It helps improve the organization and readability of test suites, particularly for larger applications.

Term: Test suite
Definition: A test suite is a collection of related tests. In the context of Jasmine, the `describe` function creates test suites by grouping specs together.

Term: Jasmine
Definition: Jasmine is a JavaScript testing framework used for writing and running tests for your code.

Term: CDN (Content Distribution Network)
Definition: A CDN is a network of servers that delivers web content, such as scripts and CSS files, to users based on their geographic location. It provides faster and more efficient access to resources.

Term: Jasmine Standalone
Definition: Jasmine Standalone is a standalone version of the Jasmine framework that includes the necessary JavaScript files and CSS for testing.

Term: Spec
Definition: In Jasmine, a spec refers to a test case or a unit of code being tested.

Term: Cleanup code
Definition: Cleanup code refers to code that is used to undo or clean up any side effects or changes made during the execution of tests.

Term: Mocking
Definition: Mocking involves creating a simulated or fake version of a function or object to isolate the code being tested and control its behavior.

Term: Sandbox
Definition: A sandbox is a controlled environment where the code being tested is isolated, and its side effects are contained.

Term: `afterEach`
Definition: `afterEach` is a hook provided by Jasmine that runs after each individual test. It allows you to perform cleanup or reset operations.

Term: beforeEach
Definition: beforeEach is a hook provided by Jasmine that runs before each individual test. It allows you to set up initial conditions or states before executing the test.

Term: beforeAll
Definition: beforeAll is a hook provided by Jasmine that runs once before all the tests in a suite. It is typically used for setup tasks that need to be done once, such as constructing a test database.

Term: afterAll
Definition: afterAll is a hook provided by Jasmine that runs once after all the tests in a suite have finished executing. It is typically used for cleanup tasks that need to be done once, such as removing a test database.

Term: Matcher
Definition: A matcher is a function provided by Jasmine that performs a comparison between an actual value and an expected value to determine the test result. Examples of matchers include toEqual, toBeGreaterThan, toBeFalsy, and toBeBetween.

Term: Unit testing
Definition: Unit testing is the practice of testing individual functions or small modules of code in isolation. It focuses on testing one unit (function) at a time and is easy to write and quick to execute. Unit tests work well with pure functions.

Term: Integration testing
Definition: Integration testing involves testing the flow and interaction between multiple functions or modules. It verifies the integration and communication between different parts of the system. Integration tests are broader in scope, more complex to write, and take more time.

Term: Pure functions
Definition: Pure functions are functions that do not have side effects and consistently return the same output for the same input. Pure functions are easier to test because they are predictable and do not change external state or data.

Term: Edge cases
Definition: Edge cases refer to testing scenarios that are outside the normal or expected range of inputs or conditions. It involves testing for unusual or exceptional situations to ensure the code handles them correctly.

Term: Testable code
Definition: Testable code refers to writing code that is easy to test by following certain principles and practices. This includes breaking code into smaller, modular functions, separating logic and UI, and avoiding complex dependencies.
