Important terms and ideas in the transcript:

1. Unit testing: Testing individual functions or small modules of code in isolation. It focuses on testing one unit (function) at a time and is easy to write and quick to execute. Unit tests work well with pure functions.

2. Integration testing: Testing the flow and interaction between multiple functions or modules. It verifies the integration and communication between different parts of the system. Integration tests are broader in scope, more complex to write, and take more time.

3. Pure functions: Functions that do not have side effects and consistently return the same output for the same input. Pure functions are easier to test because they are predictable and do not change external state or data.

4. Edge cases: Testing scenarios that are outside the normal or expected range of inputs or conditions. It involves testing for unusual or exceptional situations to ensure the code handles them correctly.

5. Testable code: Writing code that is easy to test by following certain principles and practices. This includes breaking code into smaller, modular functions, separating logic and UI, and avoiding complex dependencies.

Code snippet:

Here's a code snippet demonstrating a pure function and an integration test:

```javascript
// Pure function
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Integration test
describe('addNumbers', () => {
  it('should correctly add two numbers', () => {
    const result = addNumbers(2, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

In this example, `addNumbers` is a pure function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. The integration test verifies that the function correctly adds two numbers and expects the result to be 5.

Note: The code snippet is a simplified demonstration. In practice, you would use testing frameworks like Jasmine to write and run the tests.
